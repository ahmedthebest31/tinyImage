# Better TinyPNG (Vanilla JS & Serverless Function)

This project is a clone of popular image compression tools like TinyPNG, built with vanilla JavaScript and a serverless function. While inspired by these tools, it offers slightly better compression .

**Try it out!** [here](netlify)

**Note:** The serverless function hosting the compression logic has a maximum file size limit of 4MB, compared to TinyPNG's 5MB limit.  While this project offers better compression  for some images, the current file size limitation is a drawback. 

**Improvements:**

* Vanilla JavaScript implementation
* Serverless deployment (potentially faster response times)
* **(Potentially)** Higher compression ratio for some images

**Drawbacks:**

* Limited to 4MB file size

This project is a work in progress. The goal is to improve compression efficiency while exploring ways to increase the file size limit within the serverless environment.
